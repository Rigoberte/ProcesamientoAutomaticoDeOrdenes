#### Description

**Tracking Number Generator** is a tool designed to automate the process of managing and tracking shipment orders in clinical studies. This application simplifies workflow by allowing different teams to enter and process orders efficiently and accurately, reducing the possibility of human errors.

#### Problem

The manual process of managing shipment orders involves several steps that can be error-prone and time-consuming:
1. Loading an Excel spreadsheet with the orders.
2. Loading a table of contacts and delivery schedules for each medical center.
3. Manually collecting information for each order.
4. Manually entering data into the carrier's website to generate a tracking number.

#### Solution

**Tracking Number Generator** automates these steps by normalizing an Excel table with the order data and loading the orders into pre-configured carrier websites. This ensures a smoother and less error-prone process, adapting to different order tables and web pages.

#### Features

1. **Data Normalization**: The application normalizes order data from various Excel tables.
2. **Automatic Upload to Carrier Websites**: Orders are automatically uploaded to the pre-configured carrier websites.
3. **Tracking Number Generation**: Tracking numbers are generated automatically, facilitating the tracking of orders.
4. **Notifications**: Once a tracking number is generated, the medical center and, in some cases, the client are notified of the order delivery date.

#### Context

Each client has clinical trial studies and collaborates with multiple hospitals nationwide. Each hospital is assigned a center number (or site#) to distinguish it in the context of a specific clinical trial. Hospitals, located in different cities, have varying transit times and multiple entrances and addresses that need to be properly registered to ensure correct delivery.

Each study has designated personnel at each hospital authorized to receive the shipment orders. These personnel have fixed days of presence and specific schedules, as well as their own phone numbers and email addresses.

Shipment orders are associated with a specific study and a site identified with an IVRS number, indicating a temperature condition and a request date. Our clients request that certain documents, always the same, be printed and sent along with the shipment orders.

#### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Reduces the time and effort required to process orders.
- **Accuracy**: Minimizes human errors in data management and tracking number generation.
- **Flexibility**: Adapts to different order tables and carrier websites.
- **Automated Notifications**: Provides precise and timely information about order status to medical centers and clients.

#### Conclusion

**Tracking Number Generator** is a comprehensive solution for automating the process of managing shipment orders in clinical studies, optimizing workflow, and ensuring accuracy and efficiency at every stage of the process.
